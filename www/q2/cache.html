<p>A browser cache stores website assets and programs into your computer's hard drive so that it can be potentially used later. For example, everytime you log into a new website, your browser will store items such as images, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, etc. The types of assets stored from a website do not change frequently, therefore they are constant. If you do not clear your cookies, the MailChimp pop-up will not appear because the broswer will store information of the user closing or subscribing to the form. Since you have already completed the form, your browser will make sure you don't have to complete it again and not pop-up. By clearing your cookies, that task information is deleted and the pop-up will appear again.</p>
